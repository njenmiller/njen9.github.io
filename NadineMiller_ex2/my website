<h1>How a Child Saved Her Small Town</h1>
<p>Alyssa Drake, who is 13 years old, just saved her town from a poisonous gas. On Monday, Alyssa was walking home from school when she smelled something really nasty. "It smelled like my dog's poop," Alyssa said. She then went to her local poison control station and told them. No one could smell it, but when they got out their poison detector, it lit up like a Christmas tree. Poison control evacuated everyone and got rid of the poison. "This little girl saved us," Alyssa's neighbor told our reporter. The town is called Hanksville, Minnesota. The population is about 525 people.</h1>
